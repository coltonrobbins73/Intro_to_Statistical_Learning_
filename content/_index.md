###### First take

This text has been dubbed the machine learning bible covering the majority of fundamental concepts from linear regression to deep learning.

###### Motivation

This text seems to be the perfect entry point into the world of machine learning. It is not as inaccessible as its more math-heavy counter-part "elements of statistical learning". Hopefully, learning these concepts will enable me to tackle mathematical formulas in more detail
