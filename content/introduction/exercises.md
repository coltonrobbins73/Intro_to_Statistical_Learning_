### Conceptual problems

Refer to the text (p.63) for question set.

1.
    1. When sample size ***n*** is large and predictors ***p*** is small, a more flexible approach is generally preferred because there is likely less noise in the data and the flexible approach can usually approximate ***f*** better.
    2. The reverse scenario would favor inflexible approaches because you would need to generalize ***f*** to account for the high variability from a small data set. A method like lasso should be used to account for the large number of parameters.
    3. For non-linear relationships, flexible approaches are generally preferred
    4. When variance is high, an inflexible approach would help generalize the model to be more insensitive to the noise.

2. 
    1. Inference, regression problem. 
        - ***n*** = firms
        - ***p*** = employees, CEO salary, record profit, etc...
    2. Prediction, classification problem.
        - ***n*** = 20 similar products
        - ***p*** = price, marketing budget, success or failure, etc...
    3. Prediction, regression problem.
        - ***n*** = individual weeks
        - ***p*** = % change in overall market, etc...
